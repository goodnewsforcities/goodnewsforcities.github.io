      <p>
        We are passionate about cities.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are a pair of urbanists based in Japan. <i>Good News for Cities</i>
        are our personal, playful, "irresponsible" interventions in cities across the world through a perspective of
        being an outsider.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once in a year, we would spend one month in a city outside of Japan, where we develop a project with a local
        collaborator, regarding community development and citizen empowerment for reimaging of cities. We also publish a
        magazine after each stay, based on the research we conduct there.
      </p>
      <p>Yes. One city = one project = one magazine everytime we travel.</p>

      <p>
        <b>&#x1f6e9;　Performative intervention through traveling</b>
        <br />
        We value international collaboration and leaving contribution to a place where we travel to. We create and
        develop a short-term, playful yet impactul urban project (such as pop-up event, collective mapping, podcast,
        installation, publication) together with a local initiative.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b> 📻　Podcast</b>
        <br />
        We host a <a href="https://anchor.fm/good-news-for-cities" target="_blank">Podcast</a> where we talk about
        various issues around cities, architecture and urbanism. New episode every week. Sorry, Japanese only.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>📤　Newsletter</b><br />
        Every Thursday we also send out <a href="こちら" target="_blank">our newsletter</a>, in which we share some topics,
        projects, trends we're interested in. This is also Japanese only.
      </p>

      <p>
        *We have a company called <i>for cities</i>, but <i>Good News for Cities</i> are our independent, voluntary
        perfomative action purely out of passion. If you are interested in what we do professionally, visit <a href=""
          target="_blank">this website</a>.

            Mariko is an independent editor, journalist and researcher on architecture and urbanism. She graduated
            4CITIES Euromaser in Urban Studies, which brought her to 4 cities in various cities in Europe (Brussels,
            Vienna, Copenhagen and Madrid). After the graduation, she has been trying to cultivate a trajectory that
            completes connections between journalism and the field of architecture and urban design. She owns her own
            website Traveling Circus of Urbanism, and manages a cultural space Bridge To in Kyoto where she hosts an
            “urbanist in residence” program. She has also been organizing various workshops and educational programs and
            working as a curator.
